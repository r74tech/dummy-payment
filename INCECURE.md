### **Identified Vulnerabilities in the Mock Payment System**  

This system intentionally introduces several **security flaws** that can be leveraged for testing purposes, particularly for **security challenges** or **hardening competitions**. Below is a detailed breakdown of the vulnerabilities and their potential impact:

---

### **1. Fixed Access Token (Authentication Bypass)**  
**Issue**:  
- The access token is hardcoded to `"STATIC-TOKEN"` in the `auth.py` module.  
- This token never changes and is known to any user or attacker who has seen the code.

**Impact**:  
- Anyone with knowledge of the token can impersonate a valid user, bypass authentication, and perform actions without proper authorization.  
- Attackers can directly initiate payments or capture payments without requiring valid credentials.

**Mitigation**:  
- Use dynamically generated tokens, securely store them, and set expiration rules.  
- Implement user-based authentication and session management.

---

### **2. Session Expiry Disabled (Authorization Issues)**  
**Issue**:  
- Transactions are stored in Redis **without an expiration time**, meaning old transactions remain valid indefinitely.

**Impact**:  
- Attackers can reuse previously valid tokens for unauthorized operations (e.g., capturing payments).  
- No proper session lifecycle management increases the risk of token reuse attacks.

**Mitigation**:  
- Enforce expiration policies on tokens and sessions.  
- Invalidate tokens after use or upon session termination.

---

### **3. Lack of CSRF Protection**  
**Issue**:  
- The `/checkout` endpoint does not implement **CSRF protection**, allowing requests from unauthorized origins to trigger actions.

**Impact**:  
- Attackers can forge a request to `/checkout` if the user is logged in, initiating unauthorized payments without the userâ€™s consent.

**Mitigation**:  
- Implement CSRF tokens in forms and APIs, ensuring requests are validated against expected tokens.

---

### **4. Missing Input Validation (Injection Risks)**  
**Issue**:  
- The `/start` endpoint does not validate the input, directly accepting any JSON payload and storing it without sanitization.

**Impact**:  
- This can lead to **SQL injection** or other injection-based attacks if user input is not properly handled.
- If data is logged or sent to other systems, it could result in **log injection** or **persistent XSS**.

**Mitigation**:  
- Implement strict input validation and data sanitization.
- Use typed models for all incoming data to enforce schema constraints.

---

### **5. Unlimited Refund Requests (Business Logic Abuse)**  
**Issue**:  
- Refunds can be triggered repeatedly for the same transaction without any restrictions.  
- There is no mechanism to prevent **double spending** or **excessive refunds**.

**Impact**:  
- Attackers can issue multiple refunds, resulting in a **loss of funds**.  
- This leads to potential **denial of service (DoS)** by spamming refund requests or disrupting financial records.

**Mitigation**:  
- Track refund status and limit refunds to **one per transaction**.  
- Introduce rate-limiting or CAPTCHA to prevent automated abuse.
